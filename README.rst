Module for VEnCode-related projects based on FANTOM5 databases
==============================================================

This module contains classes and functions that do VEnCode-related operations on databases provided by the `FANTOM5
consortium`_, namely the CAGE enhancer and transcription start site (TSS) databases.

For more information on the VEnCode technology, please refer to **Macedo et al., 2017. DOI:**
