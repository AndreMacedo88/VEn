To use the following scripts which were used to generate the data for the article Macedo & Gontijo, 2019, please first
generate the more compact data sets using "generate_datasets.py", for primary cell types, and
"generate_datasets_cancer.py" for cancer cell types respectively. Remember to use these scripts for both promoter and
enhancer data. In the end your new folder should contain about 31 GBs of data.
Otherwise, you can create your own scripts around the internals.py classes and objects.
