To use the following scripts to replicate the data used for the article Macedo & Gontijo, 2019, it is advised to set
the 'parsed' argument as True in most scripts. This will just speed up the computation time. It does not work for
celltypes that are not primary or cancer cell lines (such as hIPS cells). To use 'parsed' as True, please first generate
the more compact data sets using "generate_datasets.py", for primary cell types, and "generate_datasets_cancer.py" for
cancer cell types respectively. Remember to use these scripts for both promoter and enhancer data.
In the end your new folder should contain about 31 GBs of data.
Otherwise, you can create use the default 'parsed' value, it will be several times slower because the data has to be
parsed from the original data every time.

All of this does not apply to scripts where you use your own data instead of the FANTOM5 CAGE-seq data.
